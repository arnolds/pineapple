<p>IndieShopper was my final project on Le Wagon's full-stack Web Development bootcamp, which I graduated from in December 2022 in Barcelona.</p>
<br>
<p>IndieShopper gives a platform to small, local businesses to promote their products and services, and makes it easier for people to shop locally as opposed to using giant e-commerce sites.</p>
<br>
<p>Built using a Ruby on Rails framework, my team and I designed, built and shipped to production this working MVC demo in a two-week sprint.</p>
<br>
<p>Features I enjoyed building include:</p>
<br>
<p> - A CSV upload tool for products which will be parsed and added to a shop products page</p>
<p> - An auto-generated QR code which will updated an order status when scanned by a shop owner</p>
<p> - A chat feature for users to communicate with shop owners</p>
