<p>NewsGuessr is a daily game, which gives the player 6 attempts to guess the year of the newspaper based on the headlines and events reported.</p>
<br>
<p>I built NewsGuessr as a way to reinforce what I learned after Le Wagon, and as a chance to learn some new technologies. I wanted to build a lightweight and responsive app, to make the gameplay work smoothly. The site uses more JavaScript than my previous projects to enable this. </p>
